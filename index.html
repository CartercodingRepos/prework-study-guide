        <ol>
          <li>Git Bash: to open commandline.</li>
          <li>Git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>Git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li> Git add -A: adds the starting code to the branch from main.</li>
          <li>Now we code!</li>
          <li>Git commit -m "COMMENT ON YOUR CODING CHANGES BETWEEN THE QUOTE MARKS HERE"</li>
          <li>Git pull origin main: check local branch nad main branch are in sync.</li>
          <li>Git push origin feature/NAME-OF-FEATURE-BRANCH-HERE</li>
          <li>Go to github, select the branch feature/NAME-OF-FEATURE-BRANCH-HERE, select "compare & pull request", give pull request a descriptive title like "added starter code for project", "create pull request", make first pull request, merge by clicking "merge pull request" to merge feature branch into main branch.  Finally, close any Issues in github repo. </li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An 'if' conditional is a decision that meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>An 'if else' is used when there is more than one condition.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable holding a group of data typically related in someway.  This can also be different types of data such as strings, numbers, etc.  Remember, strings are always in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Data in an array has an index number.  The first item in any array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>Use 'for' as a loop.  Loops have three parts.  Loops have a starting point variable of x with a value of 0, e.g. x = 0;  The second statement is a condition.  The conditional determines the length and uses an array.  For example an array of shapes would be:  x < shapes.length; .  The final statement increases the array by 1 each time e.g. x++ increases by 1 the same as x+1.  Therefore, together e.g.  for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {console.log (shapes[x]);}.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
