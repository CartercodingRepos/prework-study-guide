          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An 'if' conditional is a decision that meets a condition or is true.</li>
          <li>An 'if else' is used when there is more than one condition.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable holding a group of data typically related in someway.  This can also be different types of data such as strings, numbers, etc.  Remember, strings are always in quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Data in an array has an index number.  The first item in any array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>Use 'for' as a loop.  Loops have three parts.  Loops have a starting point variable of x with a value of 0, e.g. x = 0;  The second statement is a condition.  The conditional determines the length and uses an array.  For example an array of shapes would be:  x < shapes.length; .  The final statement increases the array by 1 each time e.g. x++ increases by 1 the same as x+1.  Therefore, together e.g.  for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {console.log (shapes[x]);}.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
